# BitgrailJS

A unofficial nodejs client for the https://bitgrail.com API, you can get their docs at https://bitgrail.com/api-documentation

# API keys

For private methods get a pair of API keys at https://bitgrail.com/api-keys and use both to instantiate a client like this:

```javascript
const Bitgrailjs = require('bitgrailjs');
const client = new Bitgrailjs({ apiKey: 'YOU_API_KEY_HERE', secretKey: 'YOUR_SECRET_HERE' });
```

*OBS:* To be able to use trading or withdraw methods, you must enable "Allow trading" and/or "Allow withdraw" options when generating a new pair

# Submodules

The client has 4 submodules: public, order, user and wallet. Each module implement calls to specific endpoints at bitgrail as simple methods returning promises. For example, wallet has the `getDepositAddress` method receiving a `coin` parameter, so the usage would be something like:

```javascript
const Bitgrailjs = require('bitgrailjs');
const client = new Bitgrailjs({ apiKey: process.env.API_KEY, secretKey: process.env.SECRET_KEY });
const wallet = client.wallet;

wallet.getDepositAddress('btc').then(address => console.log(address));
```

### Public

- `markets()`
- `ticker(fiat, coin)`
- `orderBook(fiat, coin)`
- `tradeHistory(fiat, coin)`

### Order

- `openOrders()`
- `buy(market, amount, price)`
- `sell(market, amount, price)`
- `cancel(id)`

### User

- `lastTrades(coin)`
- `depositsHistory(coin)`
- `withdrawsHistory(coin)`

### Wallet

- `balances()`
- `getDepositAddress(coin)`
- `withdraw(coin, amount, address)`

### Websocket

This client has no support for that at the moment, but it probably will at some point.
